Welcome to the official PubNub Unreal Engine SDK repository. [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) provides the infrastructure and APIs needed for the realtime communication layer of your application. You can focus on building your app's logic while PubNub ensures data is sent and received across the world in less than 100ms.

## Getting Started

Below, you will find everything you need to begin messaging!

### Get PubNub Keys

You will need publish and subscribe keys to authenticate your app. Get your keys from the [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/login).

### Configure Unreal Engine

1. Download and [install Unreal Engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/pl-pl/unreal-engine/installing-unreal-engine) version 5.0 or higher.
2. Create a new blank Unreal project at a location of your choice.
3. Create an empty `Plugins` folder in the location of your Unreal project.

### Download the SDK

Within the `Plugins` folder of your Unreal project, clone the Unreal SDK repository: [https://github.com/pubnub/unreal-engine](https://github.com/pubnub/unreal-engine "SDK source-code repository on GitHub").

### Blueprints and Sample Code

Each PubNub API is available through Blueprints and C++ code. For further information on using and configuring the workspace and the Unreal Engine project, refer to the [PubNub Unreal SDK documentation](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/unreal).
